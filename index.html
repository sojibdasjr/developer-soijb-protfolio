            <h1 class="h2">Jonior Developer <span class="sd">SOJiB DAS</span> World</h1>
            <p class="pj">
                My name is <span class="sd">SOJiB DAS</span> I’m a dreamer, I’m a believer and I’m a doer. I am well
                known for my
                presentation
                skill. I
                can speak very well both in Bengali and English. Another quality of me that I feel proud of is – I’m a
                quick
                learner and self-motivated person. I have learned to using computer by myself without anyone’s help.
                It’s a
                tough job for most people.I was born and brought up in Dewkhola,Fulbaria, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. I’ve
                spend
                my
                childhood in the midst of greenery, in a remote village. . My father worked as a tailor, there were 5 of
                us in the family. I am second among them. I have an older sister and a younger sister. I lost my father
                on May 10, 2020. It was a very big heartache for me .I am frank and pretty friendly. Some say I’m
                introvert but when
                it
                comes to public speaking, I sure talk! I have my only weakness which is, I can’t say No to people. I
                find it
                difficult to refuse people specially when it’s about helping them.

                Become a Web Developer
            </h3>
            <p class="h3">
                When I become a web developer, those who have insulted me all the time say that nothing will happen to
                me. I can't do any work. Then I will tell them, people never have to make fun of the present. Because
                maybe one day he will be a much bigger one in his endeavors.</p>
